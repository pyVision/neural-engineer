# neural-engineer

This repository contains projects, code examples, and source materials referenced in the Neural Engineer blog. Here you'll find practical implementations of concepts discussed in our articles, including:

- AI agent systems built with CrewAI
- Machine learning models and neural network architectures
- Data processing pipelines and utilities
- Code samples from tutorial articles

Feel free to explore the projects, use them as learning resources, or adapt them for your own work.

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions and requirements.

## Projects

- **Medium Article Generator** ( example-projects/crewai-medium-1 ) - An AI agent system using CrewAI to automate the creation of high-quality blog content
